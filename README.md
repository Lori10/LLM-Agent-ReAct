# LLM-Agent-ReAct

This project focuses on developing an advanced custom AI agent based on ReAct logic aimed at generating factual answers with references based on research publications. Language models are getting better at reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. WebGPT, SayCan, ACT-1). ReAct integrates these two effective methods—reasoning and acting—into a unified approach, enhancing the overall capabilities of language models.
